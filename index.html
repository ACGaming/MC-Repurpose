<a id="starting-house" class="anchor" href="#starting-house" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starting House</h2>

<ul>
<li>This item is added to the player's inventory the first time they join the world (or first time joining the world with the option on) and is used to create a simple player house. When using the item, the house is built at the location the item is right-clicked on and the player is teleported to that location (so the block generation doesn't kill them). It also clears a 10-block radius and 15 block height area around the player before the house building starts. This is so there is an open area for the house.</li>
<li>The house always faces north as this made placement of the blocks a lot easier.</li>
<li>The house structure materials and contents can be changed in the configuration file which can be changed manually or changed in the "Mod Options" menu item on the title screen or the pause menu.

<ul>
<li>The walls can be any of the vanilla varieties of wood planks.</li>
<li>The door and outside stair will be the same type of wood as the walls.</li>
<li>The floor can be Stone Brick, Brick (the red ones) or Sandstone.</li>
<li>The ceiling can be Stone Brick, Brick (the red ones) or Sandstone.</li>
<li>The ceiling can be flat or vaulted (made of stairs).</li>
<li>Torches can be added on the inside of the house.
*There will be 1 torch per wall.</li>
<li>A sign will be posted outside the house next to the stair with the following message.

<ul>
<li>This is</li>
<li>[Insert Players Name]</li>
<li>House!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The house can be decorated with the following items. These can all be turned off in the configuration.

<ul>

<li>If the ceiling is flat there will be multiple torches on the roof.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the ceiling is vaulted it will have 1 torch at it's peak.</li>
