This mod is designed to be an "Ease of Life" mod.

RECIPES:

	Smelt undamaged vanilla armors back to their crafted pieces.
	Smelt rotten flesh into leather. (It's the "Hello World" of modding).

	The following wood recipes are added for the vanilla wood varieties:
	1. Wood slabs in a 2x2 square into 4 sticks.
	2. Wood slabs on top of each other back into 1 plank.
	3. Wood stairs on top of each other back into 3 planks.

	The following stone recipes are added for vanilla stone varieties:
	1. Stone stairs on top of each other back into 3 blocks.
	2. Stone slabs on top of each other back into 1 block.

	Adds a recipe to turn 4 feathers and 1 string into 1 wool. The string is in the middle and feathers on each side of it.

	Adds a recipe for a nether star for those that don't want to fight the wither. It can still take some time to get.
	1 Wither Skull in each corner
	1 Diamond block in the middle
	1 Quartz block on each side of the diamond block
	Total: 4 Wither Skulls, 4 Quartz Blocks and 1 Diamond Block

	If Copper, Tin or Aluminum ingots have been registered in the OreDictionary it will add Shears and Bucket recipes for those ingots.
	
COMMANDS:
	A new command has been added. "Home".
	By typing /home, the user will be teleported to the last bed the slept in that dimension.
	So this obviously doesn't work in the Nether or End. 
	If you haven't slept in a bed yet or are in a dimension where a bed cannot be slept in, a message will appear saying it could not find the bed.
	
EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY:
	By right-clicking on a crop this mod adds functionality for you to automatically harvest the crop (if it is at full growth).
	It will also re-plant the seed of the crop if you have the appropriate seed in your inventory!

ITEMS:
	Only 1 item so far in this mod but it does a lot. The item is added to the player's inventory at spawn and is used t ocreate a simple player house.
	When using the item the house is built at the location the item is right-clicked on and the player is teleported to that location (so the block generation doesn't kill them).
	It also clears a 10 block radius and 15 block height area around the player before building the house starts.
	
	This house is static in it's design (for now) and is intended to get you a starting base of operations while you gather materials for the big stuff you have planned :).
	It is made of wood blanks for the walls and stone bricks for the floor and roof (this way lightning doesn't burn it down).
	A door is added with a pressure plate inside and a wood stair outside since the floor is elevated from the round.
	That is the base house, the rest are options which you can turn off in the config file which are described below.
	1. Adds a bed to the house.
	2. Adds a crafting table and a furnace to the house (furnace will automatically have 20 coal in it).
	3. Adds a double wide chest to the house.
		a. Adds stone tools, food(20 bread, 3 seeds, 3 potatos, 3 carrots) and leather armor to the chest.
	4. Torches are added to each wall inside the house and outside the house and the roof (since the roof is flat).
	5. Adds a small farm outside the house.
		This small farm has 3 water sources and is surrounded by 1 square of farmland on each side of the water sources.
		Glass blocks are above each water source with a torch above that glass block.
